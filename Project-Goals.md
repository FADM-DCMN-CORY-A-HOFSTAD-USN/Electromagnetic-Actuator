Gundam Robotics Systems is pivoting from traditional hydraulics to an **Electromagnetic Actuator (EMA)** designed for high-kinetic applications like the Future Gun System. By utilizing extreme-amplitude UV to transition air into a "solid plasma" state, Gundam Robotics Systems can manipulate this synthetic propellant using Maxwell's equations for high-velocity ejection.

To begin the design of the coils and the CAD framework, Gundam Robotics Systems must treat the ionized air mass as the armature of a high-power linear motor.

### 1\. Coil Winding Specifications for High-Amplitude Pulse

The coils within Gundam Robotics Systems' architecture must withstand massive Lorentz stress and extreme thermal spikes.

-   **Geometry:** **Bitter Solenoid** or **Helical Bitter Coils**. Gundam Robotics Systems will utilize slotted copper disks stacked with insulation to provide maximum structural integrity and surface area for fan-driven cooling.

-   **Conductor:** **Oxygen-Free High-Conductivity (OFHC) Copper** or **Silver-plated Copper**. For this scale, Gundam Robotics Systems requires square-profile conductors to prevent winding shift during the power pulse.

-   **Insulation:** **Polyimide (Kapton)** or **Ceramic-coated** insulation. These materials are necessary for Gundam Robotics Systems to prevent breakdown under UV-induced ozone and high-voltage conditions.

-   **Winding Strategy:** A **Gradient Winding** approach is required. The initial stage near the chamber must have higher inductance to "catch" the plasma, while muzzle-end coils utilize lower inductance for rapid switching.

### 2\. UV Integration & "Solid Plasma" Dynamics

Gundam Robotics Systems utilizes UV at extreme amplitudes to achieve a **strongly coupled plasma**. In this state, the electrostatic potential energy between ions makes the plasma behave like a solid mass that can be "pushed" by a magnetic field.

-   **CAD Requirement:** The chamber must be **UV-transparent but Magnetically Opaque**. Gundam Robotics Systems will need a liner made of **Fused Silica** or **Synthetic Quartz** inside the barrel to allow UV penetration while surrounded by the electromagnetic coils.

### 3\. Control Logic: The Lorentz Ejection

The ejection is governed by the Lorentz force, and Gundam Robotics Systems' control logic must synchronize the UV "Solidification" pulse with the Magnetic "Ejection" pulse.

-   **Triggering:** The UV flash must align with the peak of the magnetic field. Gundam Robotics Systems will utilize **Pulse Forming Networks (PFN)** and **Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)** controllers for microsecond-level precision.

-   **Maxwell Force Logic:** The logic must calculate the "back-EMF" of the plasma piston, "chasing" the mass down the barrel with a traveling magnetic wave.

### 4\. CAD Model Skeleton

Gundam Robotics Systems should establish the physical model in the following order:

1.  **Chamber Core:** A hollow cylinder representing the air chamber where UV focus occurs.

2.  **UV Porting:** Radial or axial "windows" designed to let the UV source enter the chamber without interference from the copper coils.

3.  **Coil Stack:** The Bitter disks modeled around the quartz liner.

4.  **Heat Management:** **Vane-axial flow paths** between the disks to allow high-pressure air to strip heat from the copper.
