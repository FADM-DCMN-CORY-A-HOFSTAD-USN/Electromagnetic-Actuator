Gundam Robotics Systems is finalizing the physical prototype specifications by standardizing on **Fused Silica** for the actuator's core chamber. This high-purity, non-crystalline glass is engineered for the extreme environment of a 5-microsecond "solid plasma" ejection, offering the necessary thermal and optical properties to compete with industrial -12 hydraulic fittings.

### 1\. Prototype Core: Fused Silica Advantages

Selecting fused silica over standard fused quartz provides Gundam Robotics Systems with a material synthesized from chemical precursors, resulting in higher purity and fewer metallic impurities.

-   **UV Transparency**: Fused silica is highly transparent to ultraviolet (UV) light, ensuring the high-amplitude flash penetrates the air volume effectively to induce solidification.

-   **Thermal Stability**: Its extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) allows the -12 chamber to withstand the rapid temperature spikes of the plasma state change without shattering.

-   **Structural Resilience**: The material is noted for its exceptional thermal shock resistance, which is critical for the impulsive mechanical loads of the Maxwell-force ejection.

-   **Electrical Insulation**: As a superior electrical insulator, fused silica prevents current leakage from the 48V Bitter stack into the plasma chamber.

### 2\. -12 Dash Size Integration (-12 Equivalent)

The physical prototype will be manufactured to match the standard industrial **-12 dash size**, which corresponds to a **3/4" internal diameter (ID)**.

-   **Bore Dimension**: The fused silica chamber will feature a precise 19.05 mm (0.75 in) bore to ensure it can serve as a drop-in replacement for larger machinery and high-volume flow applications.

-   **Fittings**: The assembly will be designed to interface with common industrial fitting sizes, such as **3/4" (#12)** JIC or O-ring Boss configurations.

### 3\. Power Architecture: 48V / 240W

Gundam Robotics Systems' prototype utilizes a 48V architecture to drive the electromagnetic and UV systems.

-   **Current Delivery**: At 240W, the system operates at a **5-Ampere (5A)** current flow.

-   **Efficiency**: This configuration allows for high-voltage, low-current delivery, reducing resistive heat in the Bitter coils while providing sufficient power for the 48V DC motors driving the vane-axial fans.

### 4\. Burst Testing against ASME Benchmarks

The real-world burst testing will evaluate if the pre-stressed fused silica liner can meet the safety requirements of **ASME Section VIII**.

-   **Pressure Handling**: While -12 hydraulic fittings are selected based on flow velocity and pressure, Gundam Robotics Systems must prove the fused silica can handle the impulsive 5-microsecond surge.

-   **Thermal Management**: Testing will confirm that the **vane-axial cooling fans** effectively strip heat, preventing the overheating issues that can cause fused silica or quartz to soften and deform.
