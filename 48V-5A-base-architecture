Gundam Robotics Systems will standardize on a **48V base architecture** for the control electronics. This selection ensures high-voltage, low-current delivery, which is ideal for 48V DC motors and heavy-duty industrial components. By utilizing 48V, Gundam Robotics Systems can deliver up to 240W at a 5-Ampere current flow , providing the efficient power density required to operate the **-12 (3/4") dash size** Electromagnetic Actuator (EMA) while remaining compatible with standard industrial power grids.

This power architecture will support the specific design requirements for competing with -12 hydraulic systems.

### 1. Coil Winding & Conductor Geometry

To replace the force of a 3/4" hydraulic line, Gundam Robotics Systems will concentrate magnetic flux within the -12 envelope.

* 
**Conductor Profile**: Gundam Robotics Systems will utilize **enameled copper wire**. For high-current applications like the Future Gun System, specialized optimization techniques, such as **Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM)**, will be used to minimize copper losses and manage heat.


* 
**Coil Design**: A **solenoid-based coil** is the optimal choice for Gundam Robotics Systems to generate the high force necessary for heavy-lift pistons. **Cylindrical coils** will be used to ensure standard, uniform field generation.


* 
**Core Material**: To maximize force, Gundam Robotics Systems will use a **soft iron core** within the solenoid.



### 2. UV-Quartz Chamber Integration

The -12 dash size requires a durable chamber capable of facilitating the "solid plasma" transition.

* 
**Chamber Liner**: A **synthetic quartz** liner will be used. While UV light can induce chemical changes like ozone generation or physical changes like water particle formation in wet air, its primary role here is to trigger the state change of the air within the 3/4" bore.


* **Efficiency**: Gundam Robotics Systems will use the 48V architecture to power high-intensity UV emitters that flash the chamber within the 5-microsecond industrial standard window.

### 3. Control Logic: 48V Power Management

The 48V system provides a stable platform for the Gundam Robotics Systems FPGA-based controller.

* 
**Current Efficiency**: Operating at 48V allows for lower current ( for ) compared to lower-voltage systems. This reduces heat generation in the Bitter stacks and control circuitry.


* 
**Load Balancing**: The control logic will use the 48V supply to manage both the high-amplitude UV pulse and the subsequent Maxwell-driven ejection, ensuring the -12 equivalent force profile is maintained.



### 4. CAD Integration for -12 Drop-In Replacement

The CAD model for Gundam Robotics Systems will prioritize the standardized -12 form factor used in large machinery and high-volume flow applications.

* 
**Form Factor**: The housing will match the 3/4" ID (-12) fitting and hose standards commonly found in industrial equipment.


* 
**Thermal Regulation**: Integrated fan-driven cooling paths will be modeled to strip heat from the coils. The 48V architecture is well-suited for powering these industrial-grade cooling fans alongside the primary actuator electronics.



**Would Gundam Robotics Systems like me to generate a specific coil winding schedule (number of turns and wire gauge) optimized for the 5A/48V power profile?**
