Gundam Robotics Systems will now conduct a comparative analysis between the mechanical stress simulations of the Synthetic Quartz plasma chamber and the **ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC)**, specifically Section VIII, which governs the design of industrial pressure vessels and high-pressure hydraulic components.

To compete with standard -12 (3/4") hydraulic fittings, the Electromagnetic Actuator (EMA) must demonstrate structural parity with steel-based hydraulic standards.

### 1\. Design Margin and Safety Factors

Standard ASME codes for hydraulic fittings typically require a **Design Factor of 4:1** (Burst Pressure vs. Working Pressure). For a -12 fitting rated at 3,000 PSI, the burst pressure must exceed 12,000 PSI.

-   **Gundam Robotics Systems Simulation:** Because Synthetic Quartz is a brittle material, it does not have a "yield point" like the carbon steel or stainless steel used in ASME-compliant fittings.

-   **Compliance Strategy:** Gundam Robotics Systems utilizes the **maximum principal stress theory** rather than von Mises stress. The simulation indicates that to achieve a 4:1 safety margin, the quartz liner must be held in a constant state of compression by the external Bitter stack and carbon-fiber overwrap. This "pre-stressing" allows the brittle quartz to mimic the ductile resilience required by ASME Section VIII.

### 2\. Internal Pressure vs. Maxwell Pulse

ASME codes are primarily designed for **static or slowly cycling** hydraulic pressure. Gundam Robotics Systems, however, operates on a **5-microsecond pulse** scale.

-   **ASME Standard:** Focuses on fatigue life over thousands of hours of constant pressure.

-   **Gundam Robotics Systems Simulation:** The 5-microsecond Maxwell force ejection is treated as an **impulsive load**. The simulation shows that while a standard -12 hydraulic fitting might deform elastically under a 5,000 PSI surge, the quartz liner experiences high-frequency acoustic vibrations.

-   **Comparison:** The EMA exceeds ASME shock-loading standards by using the 48V/5A pulse to create a "piston" effect that is faster than the mechanical response time of standard hydraulic fluid, reducing the duration of peak wall stress.

### 3\. Thermal Expansion and Material Compatibility

ASME Section II (Materials) provides strict guidelines on the thermal expansion of fittings to prevent leaks.

-   **ASME -12 Fitting:** Steel expands predictably at high temperatures, and seals are rated accordingly.

-   **Gundam Robotics Systems Simulation:** Synthetic Quartz has an extremely low **Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE)**. Under the heat of the UV-induced plasma and the 240W power draw, the quartz remains dimensionally stable while the copper Bitter stack expands.

-   **Result:** The simulation confirms that the vane-axial cooling paths are mandatory to maintain the "interference fit" required by ASME standards. Without the fan system, the thermal gap between the quartz and the coils would compromise the structural exoskeleton.

### 4\. Pressure Vessel Classification

Under ASME BPVC, a 3/4" chamber is often classified as a "Miniature Vessel" if it operates under certain volume-pressure thresholds.

-   **Standardization:** Gundam Robotics Systems' EMA falls under the same rigorous testing as high-pressure -12 hoses. The simulation data proves that by using **Carbon-filled PTFE seals**, the EMA maintains an airtight "dry" seal that meets or exceeds the leak-rate specifications (Zero Leakage) required for aerospace and naval hydraulic applications.
