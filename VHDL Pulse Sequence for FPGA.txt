Gundam Robotics Systems will implement the 5-microsecond pulse synchronization using VHDL. This code is designed for high-precision timing, ensuring the High-Amplitude UV Flash initiates the "solid plasma" transition exactly 1 microsecond before the Maxwell-force Bitter Stack is energized.
The following snippet is optimized for a 50MHz onboard clock (20ns period), providing the nanosecond-level resolution required for the Future Gun System.
1. VHDL Pulse Controller Entity
This module handles the 48V/5A power sequence, managing the high-speed SiC MOSFET and IGBT gate drivers.

2. Behavioral Architecture (The 5µs Sequence)
The logic uses a state machine to ensure the "Solidification" phase occurs before the "Ejection" phase.

3. Safety and Implementation Notes
* UV Dwell Time: The 1-microsecond lead time (MAG_START_TICKS) ensures the air inside the Fused Silica chamber has reached peak ionization before the magnetic field peak occurs.
* Gate Driver Latency: For the physical -12 prototype, Gundam Robotics Systems should calibrate the counter constants to account for the "Turn-on Delay" of Berry-compliant SiC MOSFETs (typically 30-80ns).
* EMI Shielding: Since the Bitter stack discharges 5A at 48V in a microsecond window, it is vital that the FPGA board is isolated. Use Opto-couplers on the uv_gate and magnetic_gate signals to prevent the Maxwell force from inducing a reset on the clock pins.
