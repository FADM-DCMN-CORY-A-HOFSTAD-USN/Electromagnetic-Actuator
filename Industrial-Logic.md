Gundam Robotics Systems is shifting the objective to heavy-lift actuation, specifically targeting the displacement of large masses with force profiles that rival or exceed industrial hydraulic cylinders. To compete with the power density of hydraulics---which commonly utilize sizes from **1/4" (-04)** for pilot lines to **1" (-16)** for high-volume flow---the electromagnetic piston must achieve massive force-to-weight ratios.

The design for Gundam Robotics Systems will prioritize the "Solid Plasma Piston" as the primary driver to replace traditional fluid-based cylinders.

### 1\. Coil Winding Specifications for Heavy-Lift Force

To generate the necessary Newton-force to compete with high-pressure hydraulics, Gundam Robotics Systems requires a high-density flux environment.

-   **Optimal Configuration:** **Helical Bitter Stacks** remain the superior choice for Gundam Robotics Systems. By stacking copper disks with high-pressure contact, the assembly acts as a massive, rigid solenoid that can withstand the internal pressures of a 5-microsecond high-power pulse.

-   **Conductor Profile:** Gundam Robotics Systems will utilize **Square-Section Silver-Plated Copper**. This maximizes the "fill factor" within the coil volume. In hydraulics, force is a product of pressure and area; in this EMA, force is a product of the magnetic flux density ($B$) and the current ($I$). Square wire ensures no wasted space, maximizing $B$.

-   **Inductance Strategy:** Since the goal is moving a heavy piston rather than a light projectile, Gundam Robotics Systems will focus on **High-Inductance Holding Coils**. These coils are designed to maintain a steady electromagnetic "grip" on the piston after the initial plasma-driven acceleration.

### 2\. The Solid Plasma Air Driver

Gundam Robotics Systems replaces hydraulic fluid with atmospheric air that is "solidified" via extreme-amplitude UV.

-   **Piston Interaction:** The high-intensity UV flash creates a dense ionized mass behind the physical piston. This "solid plasma" acts as a near-incompressible medium.

-   **Maxwell's Force Ejection:** Instead of a pump pushing oil, Gundam Robotics Systems uses the Lorentz force to "eject" or push this plasma mass against the back of the heavy-duty piston. This allows Gundam Robotics Systems to achieve the "instant-on" force characteristics of a hydraulic accumulator without the lag of fluid travel.

### 3\. Control Logic: Competitive Pressure Management

To compete with hydraulic systems, Gundam Robotics Systems' control logic must emulate "Variable Displacement" pump behavior.

-   **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM):** Gundam Robotics Systems will use high-frequency PWM to regulate the force. By varying the duty cycle of the magnetic field within that 5-microsecond window, the system can provide "feathered" control for delicate movements or "max-out" for heavy lifts.

-   **Back-EMF Sensing:** Gundam Robotics Systems will implement real-time sensing of the piston's position. As the heavy weight moves, it creates a back-electromotive force in the Bitter coils; the Gundam Robotics Systems controller uses this as a direct feedback loop to adjust power, effectively acting as a digital pressure relief valve.

### 4\. CAD Integration: Competing with Hydraulic Form Factors

Gundam Robotics Systems must design the CAD model to fit into the same mounting envelopes as standard hydraulic cylinders (e.g., Clevis or Trunnion mounts).

1.  **Chamber Walls:** The internal barrel must be a **Synthetic Quartz liner** capable of withstanding the mechanical shock of the heavy piston while remaining transparent to the UV "solidification" pulse.

2.  **Structural Overwrap:** Because Gundam Robotics Systems is moving large weights, the mechanical recoil is significant. The CAD model will feature a **Titanium or Carbon-Fiber Exoskeleton** around the Bitter coils to ensure the assembly does not expand or "barrel" under load.

3.  **Cooling & Drying:** Gundam Robotics Systems will integrate the fan-driven airflow channels directly into the CAD skeleton. This ensures that even during rapid, heavy-lift cycles, the mechanical heat is stripped away, keeping the internal air dry and the plasma transition consistent.
